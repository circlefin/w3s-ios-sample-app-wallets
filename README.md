# Web3 Wallet Address Generator

Welcome to the Web3 Wallet Address Generator repository! This sample iOS app provides developers with foundation for creating web3 wallet addresses after a user has completed a social sign-in through Apple or Google. 

### Overview

The Web3 Wallet Address Generator demonstrates the integration of social sign-in functionality with web3 wallet address generation in an iOS app. It leverages the authentication capabilities provided by Google and Apple, enabling users to seamlessly login to the app using their Apple or Google accounts. Upon successful authentication, the app generates a web3 wallet address for the user, which can be used to securely store and manage digital assets or currencies such as USDC on the blockchain. 

### Key Features
* Deploy, embed, and manage wallet transactions in your app with REST API
* Advanced security through Multi-Party Computation(MPC) technology, ensuring enhanced protection of user assets and reducing single points of failure
* Flexible custody models allowing developers to choose between user-controlled wallets or developer-controlled wallets based on the needs
* Currently supports Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche, with other chains coming soon
